					<h1>JavaScript CSS</h1>
					<b>this is JS</b>
					<p>You can see there is some new games coming out lately because I have been working on some JavaScript. I didn't  know  much about it because it 
					was hard for me to use.<br/>So I started asking my dad some questions, it helped me a lot because he explains it clearly so I understand how to use them.<br/>
					It is really hard to make a game, it takes about 86 lines of code to code the jewelry maker game. I think that coding JavaScript tells me that I need to try everything<br/>
						even if it really hard, but if you try you will always get it at the end.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about CSS:<br/>I thought that it was really easy but it was a bit hard.<br/>
						I don't use CSS that much except for the background. But now I have been using it to change how the website looks.<br/>So here, the story of  my  adventure with JavaScript
								and CSS, BYE!</p>
