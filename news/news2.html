				<h1>The Second Blog</h1>
				<p>In this blog I am just talking about the updates!<br/>In this update the comment page is added so you can comment on my website.<br/>The user name is just a name so i know who you are.<br/>
				For safety reasons please don't put your real name.<br/>There will be a wall of names to let everyone know who's been here, and also don't put your real name there.<br/>
				I've figured a way to make the live blog: I can use the comment page's code and put it on there, but I did have problems trying to copy and paste the code to make it work.<br/>The last thing is that can everyone thank my dad for writing the comment page's code, because I didn't know a way to do it.<br/>So you can have fun writing down some comments!</p>
