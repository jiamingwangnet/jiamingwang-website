					<p>Hello,this is my first blog,so its not going to be very good</p>
					<p>So I started coding html css last year (2017) and I was soooooo happy that my dad taught me how to code.<br/>Do you know that this is also made by html?
					<br/> I was making the web page then I didn't have time to do the blog so thats why its taking so long.I don't know what I am taking about so...<br/>
					I do things outside mostly,I am planning on a live blog thing so people can see me doing things live.<br/>I am also planning on a game thats coming soon because I'm just getting ideas.<br/>
					If you are reading this then please give me some ideas when the live blog is starting because it will help me a lot.<br/>Please also tell me any bugs, spelling mistakes/typos or something I can improve to make this website better in the live blog,thank you!</p>
