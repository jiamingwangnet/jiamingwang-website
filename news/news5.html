				<h1>NEWS 5</h1>
					<p>Hello, I am back! isn't the new update good? It is my favorite one. It added icons, new menu bar and more for you to explore.<br/>
					This update is made to make the website look better. If you click on the about me link it will take you to a place similar to my first news/blog. It is now changed.<br/>
					If you want to go back use: jiamingwang.co.nf/2017/12-18/index.html ! The website now records how many times you have visited the homepage.<br/>
					Now if you want to see the time then go down to the digital clock. It shows 24 hour time.<br/>
					<b>I'll leave the rest for you to explore. BYE!</b></p>
